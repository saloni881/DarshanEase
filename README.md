# Technical Architecture – DarshanEase

## 1. Architectural Overview
DarshanEase is designed as a three-tier full-stack MERN application that ensures modularity, scalability, and secure data management. The system separates concerns across presentation, application, and data layers.

1. Presentation Layer – React.js (Frontend UI)
2. Application Layer – Node.js + Express.js (Backend API & Business Logic)
3. Data Layer – MongoDB (Persistent Data Storage)

Client (Browser)
      ↓
React.js Frontend
      ↓ (REST API via Axios)
Express.js Server (Node.js)
      ↓
Authentication & Role Middleware
      ↓
MongoDB Database (Mongoose ODM)

This layered approach ensures clear responsibility separation and maintainable code structure.

## 2. Architectural Pattern

The system follows:
- MVC (Model–View–Controller) Pattern
- RESTful API Architecture
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Modular Backend Structure

### MVC Mapping
- Model → Mongoose Schemas (User, Temple, Slot, Booking, Donation)
- View → React Components and Pages
- Controller → Express Route Controllers handling business logic

## 3. Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React.js with a component-based architecture.

### Key Characteristics

- Reusable UI components
- Page-level routing using React Router
- Axios for API communication
- Context API for global authentication state
- Role-based UI rendering

User Action
   ↓
React Component
   ↓
Axios API Request
   ↓
Backend Response
   ↓
UI State Update

The frontend handles validation, protected routes, and responsive layouts.

## 4. Backend Architecture

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js with a modular folder structure.

### Request Processing Flow
Route → Controller → Business Logic → Model → Database

### Core Modules
- Authentication Module
- Temple Management Module
- Darshan Slot Management Module
- Booking Module
- Donation Module
- Admin & Organizer Management Module

Each module is independently structured with dedicated routes, controllers, and models.

## 5. Authentication & Authorization
DarshanEase implements JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization.

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials.
2. Password verified using bcrypt.
3. JWT token generated.
4. Token returned to client. 
5. Token attached in request header for protected routes.

### Role-Based Access Control

Roles implemented:
- USER
- ORGANIZER
- ADMIN

Middleware validates:
- Token authenticity
- User role
- Route access permission

This ensures secure access to sensitive operations.

## 6. Database Architecture
The application uses MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for schema modeling and relationship management.

### Collections
- Users – Authentication and role information
- Temples – Temple details and organizer reference
- DarshanSlots – Slot timings, capacity, and availability
- Bookings – User-slot relationship and booking records
- Donations – Temple donation records

Relationship Structure

User → Booking → DarshanSlot → Temple

Indexes are applied on frequently queried fields such as:
- userId
- templeId
- slotId

This improves query performance and scalability.

## 7. Booking System Architecture
The booking system is designed to ensure data consistency and prevent overbooking.

### Booking Flow

1. User selects temple and slot.
2. Backend validates:
- Authentication status
- Slot availability
- Seat capacity

3. Available seats are updated.
4. Booking record is created.
5. Confirmation response is returned.

This controlled flow prevents unauthorized access and seat conflicts.

## 8. API Design
All APIs follow REST principles:

- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- JSON request/response format
- Standard HTTP status codes
- Centralized error handling

Example Endpoints:

POST   /api/auth/login
GET    /api/temples
POST   /api/slots
POST   /api/bookings
DELETE /api/bookings/:id

## 9. Security Architecture

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Role validation middleware
- Protected routes
- Environment variable configuration
- Centralized error handling middleware
- CORS configuration for controlled acces

## 10. Scalability & Maintainability

The architecture ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular codebase
- Independent feature expansion
- Stateless authentication for horizontal scaling
- Optimized database queries through indexing

 # User Flow – DarshanEase

![User Flow Diagram](docs/user-flow-diagram.png)

## Flow Explanation

1. The user opens the DarshanEase application and lands on the Home Page.
2. The system checks if the user is logged in.
3. If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to Login or Register.
4. Once authenticated, the user accesses their Dashboard/Profile.
5. The user selects a temple they wish to visit.
6. The system displays available darshan slots for the selected temple.
7. The user checks if the desired slot is available.
8. If the slot is available, the user selects the time slot and confirms the ticket booking
9. The system generates an electronic ticket (E-Ticket) with a unique Booking ID.
10. The user can view their bookings and booking history.
11. The flow ends after the user reviews their bookings or booking history.

# MVC Architecture

The DarshanEase backend application follows the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern.  
MVC separates an application into three interconnected layers, making the system easier to maintain, scale, and understand.

## 1. Model Layer (Data Layer)
The Model layer manages all data-related logic. It defines the structure of the application's data and interacts with the database.
In this project, models are implemented using Mongoose, which provides a schema-based solution for working with MongoDB.

Responsibilities of the Model layer:
- Define database schemas
- Perform database operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Handle data validation
- Communicate directly with MongoDB

## 2. Controller Layer
The Controller layer acts as the bridge between the routes and the models.
It processes incoming requests, performs necessary validations, interacts with the models, and returns responses to the client.

Responsibilities of the Controller layer:
- Receive HTTP requests
- Process request data
- Call appropriate model functions
- Send responses back to the client

## 3. View Layer (Routing Layer)
In a backend REST API, the view layer is represented by the **routing system**.
Routes define the available API endpoints and determine which controller function should handle each request.

Responsibilities of the View (Routing) layer:
- Define API endpoints
- Handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Connect requests to the appropriate controller

## Advantages of Using MVC in This Project

- Separation of Concerns
  Each layer has a clear responsibility, improving code readability and maintainability.

- **Scalability**  
  New features can be added by creating new models, controllers, and routes.

- **Reusability**  
  Business logic written in controllers and models can be reused across the application.

- **Testing**  
  Controllers and models can be tested independently.

- **Collaboration-Friendly**  
  Multiple developers can work on different layers simultaneously without conflicts.
